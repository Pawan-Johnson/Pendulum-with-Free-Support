# Pendulum-with-Free-Support
This is a basic study of a pendulum with a horizontally moving support. Only
Planar motion of the pendulum is considered and the support is modelled as a
particle constrained in 1 dimensional motion, attached to the pendulum bob by
means of a rigid connector.
## Contents:
- When support has constant velocity
- When Support is not acted upon by any forces
  - Analytical Solution for Small Oscillations
  - A sum total of 13 different inital cases and their Plots
